Hi there, I'm James Connolly 👋

I'm a recent Software Development graduate from TUS, Limerick, with a passion for building intelligent systems and tackling complex problems. My focus is on backend development and machine learning, particularly using reinforcement learning to create real-world, data-driven solutions.

I have hands-on experience across the full development lifecycle, from designing cloud infrastructure for a startup to implementing and benchmarking ML models for my final year project.

🛠️ My Tech Stack

Languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript

Machine Learning & Data: PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Backend & Frameworks: Node.js, Spring Boot, React

Cloud & DevOps: AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB), Google Cloud, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Tools & Environments: Linux, Git, Docker, SUMO

<br /><br />
My final year project (awarded 87%), a multi-agent reinforcement learning system built in Python to optimise urban traffic flow. I implemented and benchmarked Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents against traditional baselines in a SUMO simulation environment.
